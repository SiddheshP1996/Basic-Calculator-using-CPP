# Calculator-using-CPP

# Implementing a calculator in C++ using the concept of the classes.

# Functions :
  ``add`` to Add two numbers.
  
  ``sub`` to Subtract two numbers.
  
  ``mult`` to Multiply two numbers.
  
  ``div`` to Divide two numbers.
  
# Approach :

  Declare local variables ``x``, ``y`` for two ``float`` numeric values.

  Enter the Choice.
  
  Takes two numbers, ``x`` and ``y``.
  
  do-while jump to an operator selected by the user.
  
  Display the operation result.
  
  Exit.
  
# Examples :
  Input : ``x = 5``, ``y = 10``, ``choice = 1``
  
  Output : ``Sum is 15``
  
  Input : ``x = 10``, ``y = 4``, ``choice  = 3``
  
  Output : ``Product is 40``

  Input : ``x = 20``, ``y = 4``, ``choice = 4``
  
  Output : ``Division is 5``
  
  Input : ``x = 10``, ``y = 4``, ``choice = 2``
  
  Output : ``Difference is 6``
